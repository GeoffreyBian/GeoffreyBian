### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Geoffrey Bian, and I am a **Computer Engineering student at the University of British Columbia (Class of 2027)**. Welcome!

Iâ€™m passionate about **software and hardware development**, with experience in:

- **Programming & Frameworks:** Python, C, C++, Java, Go, Rust, JavaScript, React, Node  
- **Systems & Hardware:** CAN, TCP/IP, AWS IoT, PLCs, Altium, SystemVerilog, ARM  
- **Tools & Technologies:** MATLAB (Simulink), Linux, Git, Docker, Bazel, SCons, VS Code  

Iâ€™ve interned at **Tesla** and **Rivian**, working on projects ranging from **SCADA systems and Battery Energy Storage Systems** to **Vehicle Body Control Features** such as **Vehcile Access** and **Exterior Lighting**. At UBC, Iâ€™ve also contributed to **UBC Baja and Formula Electric teams**, developing embedded systems, PCBs, and CAN bus communication protocols.

Beyond engineering, I enjoy staying active and challenging myself with:

- **Running** (currently training for a marathon and Olympic triathlon in 2026) 
- **Team sports:** hockey, basketball, ultimate frisbee  
- **Anything Outdoors:** bouldering and hiking  

Iâ€™m also an avid reader of **science fiction**, currently diving into *The Three-Body Problem* series.

Iâ€™m always open to collaboration, learning, and connecting with fellow developers and engineers!
